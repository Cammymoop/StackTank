Basic style ideas:
 low level emission color on everything instead of ambient lighting
 easy outline
 sharp sun, not too bright, casts shadows
  shadows are not too dark because everything emissive
 very bright dynamic shots with abrupt cutoff and low distance
 no GI
 distant shot lights not enabled?
 distance fog to grey?
 full brightness emisive shots that aren't effected by dist fog?
