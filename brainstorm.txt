Stacking tank arena game

defeated tanks become pickups which go onto your head

getting defeated with one or more stacked tanks causes you to take control of second tank up from the bottom and scatters the rest
you can collect them but endanger yourself doing so

how to score points/win?
 kills?
 bonus points for picking up a tank unless you already scored it?


This should be multiplayer for sure, idk if I'll have time
Should I focus on mobile controls too s that community play can actually have a big game?
 Big if true...
